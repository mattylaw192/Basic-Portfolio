    <p>Born in the corn jungles of Illinois, Matt was surrounded by vegetables and subpar sports teams from day 1. The
        lack of success that surrounded him was <em>frustrating</em>. Matt was a "winner", and knew he had to get out.
    </p>

    <p>The next logical step for Matt was to move to a different city - one with a winning attitude. Matt pulled a
        "Lebron" by leaving a city devoid of opportunity and relocated to Boston. 3 World Series, 5 Super Bowls, 1 NBA
        Championship, and 1
        Stanley Cup later, Matt is still in New England, basking in the "winning glory". </p>

    <p>Matt has mimiced the winning ways of New England, and applied them to his career. "Do Your Job" and "No Days
        Off" are tattooed on his forehead, impressing potential employers. </p>

    <p>Now the Digital Marketing Strategist at an Ad Agency, Matt makes a living behind a computer. (Thankfully...
        Clients don't take kindly to permanent facial ink on someone who's taking their money) He currently develops
        and manages annoying online advertisements, and couldn't be happier.</p>
